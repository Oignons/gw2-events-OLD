If ANet does not want to give us the precise location of the events, I'll probably create a community tool where everyone would be able to indicate events on the map in order to add them to the final map.\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n========\r\n\r\nInspired by : https://github.com/lpdumas/gw2cartographers\r\n\r\nÂ© 2011 ArenaNet, Inc.
