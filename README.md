About
=====

A simple event tracker for GW2 using their API.

Use
===

Just select a server on the left top corner of the page and check the boxes to show or not events on the map.

Future of the project
=====================

I'll add some features and optimizations. If ANet does not want to give us the precise location of the events, I'll probably create a community tool where everyone would be able to indicate events on the map in order to add them to the final map.
